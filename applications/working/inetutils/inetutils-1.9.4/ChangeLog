2015-05-27  Alfred M. Szmidt  <ams@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am (ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): New variable.

2015-06-06  Guillem Jover  <guillem@hadrons.org>

	* ftp/cmds.c (setpeer): Misspelled message.

2015-05-22  Guillem Jover  <guillem@hadrons.org>

	libls: Alignment issue on sparc systems.
	The test suite executed by Debian's build daemon
	uncovered a failure on sparc due to incomplete
	alignment on word boundaries.

	* libls/fts.c (ALIGNBYTES, ALIGN): New macros.
	(fts_alloc): Add ALIGNBYTES to the size being allocated
	to P, a structure FTSENT.  Then compose the assignment of
	`P->fts_statp' with macro ALIGN to force correct alignment
	for the pointer to `struct stat'.

2015-05-19  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ifconfig: Fix BSD-specific interface access.
	Recently FreeBSD abandoned support for ioctl calls
	with SIOCGIFNETMASK and SIOCGIFBRDADDR.  Instead the
	use of `struct ifaddrs' is the only mechanism.  This
	had already been put to use in other cases, and is
	portably available in all BSD flavours.

	* ifconfig/system/bsd.c (system_fh_brdaddr_query)
	(system_fh_brdaddr, system_fh_netmask_query, system_fh_netmask):
	New functions.
	* ifconfig/system/bsd.h (SYSTEM_FORMAT_HANDLER): Add the new
	functions to this list, thus replacing the default handlers.
	Also add their prototypes.

2015-05-18  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ftp: Accept named, non-numerical ports.

	* ftp/cmds.c (setpeer): Test whether port string looks
	numerical.  Perform a look-up in the contrary case.

2015-05-17  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ifconfig: Regression during interface selection.
	Without arguments, ifconfig is expected to print status
	of all interfaces that are in state `UP'.  The mechanism
	to detect this state was corrupted when 32-bit flags were
	implemented.  The issue was reported by Juergen Daubert in
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-inetutils/2015-05/msg00002.html

	* ifconfig/printif.c (fh_ifdisplay_query): Logically invert
	every use of N.
	[SIOCGIFFLAGS] (fh_ifdisplay_query): Calculate UFLAGS after
	executing `ioctl(SIOCGIFFLAGS)', since only then is the value
	of `form->ifr->ifr_flags' valid.  This side effect of ioctl()
	was not taken into account in previously committed code with
	32-bit flags.

2015-05-13  Guillem Jover  <guillem@hadrons.org>

	ping, ping6: Always use line buffered output.
	When stdout is redirected, libc will change the stream to
	be fully buffered.  Suppress this, gaining the standard
	behaviour of other implementations.  Issue was first reported
	as a wishlist bug of Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/782727.

	* ping/ping.c (main): Request line buffering on stdout, adding
	a call to setvbuf().
	* ping/ping6.c (main): Likewise.

2015-05-12  Alfred M. Szmidt  <ams@gnu.org>

	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add announce-gen.

2015-05-02  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	* tests/inetd.sh (PASSWD, PWDDB, PROTOCOLS): New variables.
	Check for system files required by `inetd'.  Skip test when
	not found, which can happen in incomplete chroots.

2015-04-17  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	* ftpd/conf.c, ftpd/ftpd.c, ifconfig/system/bsd.c,
	ifconfig/system/linux.c, libtelnet/encrypt.c: Remove
	duplicate semicolon.

2015-04-16  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	* cfg.mk (git-version-gen-tag-sed-script): New variable using
	the same sed script as found in `configure.ac'.  It is needed
	to get a more reliable target `dist'.

	* tests/.gitignore: Add some generated test products.

2015-04-15  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	* bootstrap: Updated from gnulib.
	* doc/.gitignore: Add `/gendocs_template_min'.  The file
	is added during bootstrap.

2015-04-09  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	Incomplete test of syslogd.
	Whenever message passing via local socket is disabled,
	the wrapping test caused a false negative.  Fix this by
	letting it fall back to an INET socket.

	* tests/syslogd.sh: Include the `wrapping message' whenever
	either of $do_unix_socket or $do_inet_socket is true.  Fix the
	counter COUNT_WRAP to be set under the same prerequisite only.

2015-04-08  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	syslogd: Overlapping string locations.
	Configuration lines with leading white space are normalized
	by copying a string to an overlapping location.  Issue found
	by Alex Kost and reported to us in
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-inetutils/2015-04/msg00001.html

	* src/syslogd.c (load_conffile): Declare P in smallest
	possible code block.  Use `memmove' instead of `strcpy'
	to neutralize the effects of overlapping locations.

	* tests/syslogd.sh: Add a new test case, checking resistance
	to leading white space and wrapped lines in configuration file.
	(OUT_NOTICE, COUNT_NOTICE, wrapped, COUNT_WRAP): New variables.

2015-04-02  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	Testing of inetd service.

	* tests/inetd.sh: In verbose mode, report the value of USER.
	Include a printout of the configuration file when the SIGHUP
	test loop fails.

2015-03-31  Alfred M. Szmidt  <ams@gnu.org>

	* doc/inetutils.texi: Re-order chapters.

2015-03-30  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	Texinfo: Slight reordering of nodes.
	This makes all chapters consistent in themselves.

	* doc/inetutils.texi: Put direntry `dnsdomainname' first in
	dircategory `Individual utilities', for alphabetic reasons.
	Interchange nodes `dnsdomainname invocation' and `hostname
	invocation' in response to that change.
	(ftp invocation): In sub-menu, move `The .netrc file' to be
	last entry in the list.  Move the node `Ftp environment' from
	last to third relative position in this chapter.  Position
	three comes from the ordering in the established sub-menu.

2015-03-30  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	Texinfo: Improve typeset output.

	* doc/inetutils.texi: Replace all @smallexample by @example.
	(inetd invocation): Make the multi-line example two spaces
	narrower in order to fit into a rendered PDF page.
	(tftpd invocation): Rephrase a sentence for easier line breaks,
	thus avoiding text extending into the right margin.

2015-03-21  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	Portability of time format string.

	* telnetd/utility.c (_var_short_name) <case 'd'>: Change `%P'
	to `%p' in format string for strftime(), as the former is a
	GNU exclusive extension of no portability at all.  Another
	conversion specifier `%l' is not POSIX conforming, but seems
	to be generally supported, so it is left untouched.

2015-03-20  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	telnetd: Texinfo documentation.

	* doc/inetutils.texi (telnetd invocation): Add a section
	on the use of replacement tokens in the execution string.

2015-03-19  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	telnetd: Enable autologin in legacy mode.
	Without Kerberos authentication the autologin code was not
	determining what user name to hand over to the login service.
	Adding the user name, when applicable, resolves the issue.
	Bug was reported by Kuaikuai Wu in
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-inetutils/2014-12/msg00010.html

	* telnetd/telnetd.c [SOLARIS10] (login_invocation):
	Add device path "-d %L" and user name "%U", the latter
	in the form of an else clause to the selector "%?u".
	[!SOLARIS10] (login_invocation): Likewise for "%U" only.

	* telnetd/utility.c (getterminaltype): Change the paramater
	name `user_name' to `uname', as the former shadows a precious
	and global variable name.
	(_var_short_name) <case 'L'>: New case, returning full path
	to the PTY device assigned to client.
	<case 'U'>: New case, returning a copy of the environment
	variable USER, or an empty string.

2015-03-16  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ftp: Honour host aliases.
	While establishing the connection, do not replace the desired
	peer name with its canonical name.  This prevents correct use
	of the netrc file.  Bug reported by John Sullivan in
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-inetutils/2015-02/msg00000.html

	* ftp/cmds.c (setpeer): Do not assign value from hookup()
	to HOST.  Instead, only test if it is non-null.

2015-03-15  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	telnetd: Suppress PTY packet data.
	The server is receiving PTY input in packet mode, but is not
	properly discarding PIOCPKT_DATA before handing over input
	to the network socket.  Do this correctly.

	* telnetd/telnetd.c (telnet_run) <input from pty>: Break the
	loop also if pty_read() returns zero.  Add a final call to
	pty_get_char() before ending FD_ISSET(pty, &ibits).  This call
	was mistakenly located within the subcase where TIOCPKT_NOSTOP
	or TIOCPKT_DOSTOP is handled.

2015-03-14  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	Complaints during IPv6-less testing.
	Unused IPv6 directives cause logged complaints by inetd.

	* tests/ftp-localhost.sh: Add a tcp6 listener to `inetd.conf'
	only if TEST_IPV6 is not `no'.
	* tests/tftp.sh: Likewise with udp6.

2015-03-14  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	Build failures while IPv6 is disabled.

	* configure.ac (ENABLE_hstrerror): New conditional variable.

	* src/rlogind.c [IPV6] (checkhost): Move right parenthesis
	outside of precompiler conditional.

	* telnetd/Makefile.am [ENABLE_hstrerror]: Add $(LIBRESOLV)
	to LDADD.  With IPv6 disabled, the code in `telnetd/telnetd.c'
	uses hstrerror(), so Solaris must link against libresolv.

2015-02-28  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	Fully configure testing without IPv6.
	Pick up testing addresses for IP and IPv6 at configuration time.
	Now a BSD jail can successfully test all network services.

	* configure.ac (TARGET, TARGET6): New precious variables.  Set their
	default values.
	* tests/Makefile.am (tools_subst): Add TARGET and TARGET to substi-
	tution rules.
	* tests/tools.sh.in (TARGET, TARGET6): New variables.

	* tests/ifconfig.sh (TARGET, target): New variables.
	(find_lo_addr): Replace hardcoded `127.0.0.1' with `$target'.
	* tests/ping-localhost.sh <ping6>: Add a test `$TEST_IPV6 != no'.
	* tests/syslogd.sh (TARGET6): Remove surrounding brackets.
	<$TEST_IPV6 != no>: Enclose `$TARGET6' in brackets for `$LOGGER'.

2015-02-27  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	Allow testing without IPv6.
	Configuration with `--disable-ipv6' as well as individual
	tests with `TEST_IPV6=no' need to avoid mandatory IPv6.

	* configure.ac (TEST_IPV6): New precious variable.
	* tests/Makefile.am (tools_subst): Add substitution of TEST_IPV6.
	* tests/tools.sh.in (TEST_IPV6): New variable.

	* tests/ftp-localhost.sh: Check `$TEST_IPV6 != no' before adding
	any test cases with IPv6 addressing.
	* tests/syslogd.sh: Likewise.
	* tests/telnet-localhost.sh: Likewise.
	(TARGET46): New variable, defaulting to `::ffff:$TARGET'.

	* tests/tftp.sh (TARGET, TARGET6): New variables.
	<$ADDRESSES = sense>: Compute this case before building a default
	address list.  Add switch `-a' when executing $IFCONFIG.
	(ADDRESSES): Start with TARGET, add TARGET6 if `$TEST_IPV6 != no'.

2015-01-31  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	telnet: Printing of uninitialized characters.
	When preparing submodes of linemode for presentation, in case
	no submode is set, the string to be printed might make use of
	uninitialized string content, in an otherwise sane call to
	fprintf().  This is in error already in the legacy code.

	* telnet/utilities.c (printsub) <LM_MODE>: Test TBUF[0]
	to calculate replacement string, since TBUF[1] is not
	guaranteed to be initialized by the preceding sprintf().

2015-01-30  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	* bootstrap: Updated from gnulib.

2015-01-20  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	telnetd: Incomplete processing of PTY data.
	The reception of SIGCHLD can make the transfer of data from
	the PTY stream to the client side's network stream incomplete.
	The problem was raised as Debian Bug #607415, but is applicable
	also here, due to a common origin.  A setting with the option
	`-E /some/script' displays this error irregularly.

	* telnetd/telnetd.c (pending_sigchld): New variable.
	(telnetd_setup): Call setsig() when assigning SIGCHLD.  Set the
	action to chld_is_done().
	(telnetd_run) <I/O-loop>: If pending_sigchld is set, flush the
	network output buffer and exit the loop with cleanup(SIGCHLD).
	(chld_is_done): New function, used as signal action.

	* telnetd/utility.c (pty_read) <DEBUG>: Set consistent text
	prefixes in output.
	(printdata): Cast char array value as `unsigned char' to avoid
	an implicit cast as integer, implied in the format string `%02x'.

2015-01-17  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	* telnetd/state.c (dooption) : Remove outdated and misnamed
	ifdef on TELOPT_ENVIRON.
	(suboption): Remove outdated ifdef on TELOPT_NEW_ENVIRON.
	(send_status) <DEBUG>: Pass only the suboption payload into
	printsub(), by stepping over IAC+SB in the string buffer.
	* telnetd/utility.c (printsub) <default>: When an unexpected
	mode must be reported numerically, print the correct byte in
	pointer[0], not some other pseudo-random value.

2014-11-11  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	* bootstrap: Updated from gnulib.

2014-11-11  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ping: Fix testing when ping6 is not built.
	Reported by jb999 in bug-inetutils.

	* tests/ping-localhost.sh: Bracket test clauses to
	conform with intuitive logic and precedence rules.

2014-10-17  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	syslogd, logger: Incomplete range checking.

	* src/logger.c (IU_MAX_FAC): Delete macro.
	(decode): Use LOG_FACMASK in range checking.  The use of
	numeric facilities was broken for the most part.

	* src/logprio.h [!LOG_MAKEPRI] (LOG_MAKEPRI): Change to
	a portable and correct definition.
	[!INTERNAL_MARK] (INTERNAL_MARK): Adjust to the corrected
	behaviour of LOG_MAKEPRI.

	* src/syslogd.c [!LOG_MAKEPRI] (LOG_MAKEPRI): Change to
	a portable and correct definition.
	(printline): Reset `pri' to DEFUPRI whenever the facility
	is non-existent.  This protects against CVE-2014-3684.
	Make a three bit shift of LOG_KERN for code consistency.
	(cfline): After decoding priority, check also upper limit.
	Likewise for facility, and update `facilities_seen' only
	after a completed range error check.

	* tests/syslogd.sh (OUT_UNOTICE, OUT_LOCAL0): New variables.
	(COUNT4, COUNT5, COUNT4_notice, COUNT4_illegal, COUNT5_user)
	(COUNT5_local): Likewise.
	Add three new configuration stanzas to initial setup, all with
	invalid information.  In the second setup, capture facility
	`info' exactly, and make a new `notice' also exact.  Add a
	further file in the conf-directory, specifying capture of
	`local0.=notice'.  Add five new test messages using Unix
	socket, intending to detect more accurately the handling of
	priorities, numerical as well as illegal or default values.

2014-08-29  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	* tests/libls.sh: Add a dummy execution of $LS in order
	to avoid a false negative caused by code coverage runs.

2014-08-13  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	* tests/libls.sh <VERBOSE>: Execute `set -x'.
	(REPLY_a1, REPLY_A1, diff): Changed.  Update the check
	based on these, thus avoiding `sed -n '$='' which could
	not be trusted on NixOS' build daemon.

2014-08-11  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	* tests/libls.sh: Improve failure diagnostic when testing
	the switches `-a' and `-A'.  The build daemon at NixOS had
	an issue during this subcase.

2014-08-03  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	Support libshishi with Sun Studio.

	* configure.ac <shishi>: Call AC_SEARCH_LIBS, not AC_CHECK_LIB,
	when looking for libshishi.  This allows the C-compiler from
	Sun Studio 12.1 to correctly detect and build shishi support.

2014-08-02  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	More tests for better code coverage.

	* tests/Makefile.am [ENABLE_libls] (dist_check_SCRIPTS):
	Add `libls.sh'.
	[ENABLE_ftp] (dist_check_SCRIPTS): Add `ftp-parser.sh'.
	* tests/ftp-parser.sh: New script.
	* tests/ifconfig.sh: Add more test cases.
	* tests/libls.sh: New script.

	* ifconfig/options.c (formats): Add format `?' as a synonym
	for format `help'.

2014-08-01  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ping, ping6: Repair pattern production.
	A pattern stated on the command line was never made
	productive, instead only nulls were inserted to the
	correct length.

	* ping/ping.c, ping/ping6.c (pattern_len): Set to MAXPATTERN.
	(parse_opt): Size of PATTERN is now MAXPATTERN.

	* ping/ping_common.h (MAXPATTERN): New macro.
	* ping/ping_common.c (init_data_buffer): Increment I before
	checking for end of pattern.  This avoids an insertion of
	the closing null character.
	(decode_pattern): Remove _GL_UNUSED_PARAMETER on `pattern_data'.
	Insert scanned data C into pattern buffer.

2014-08-01  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	* ftp/ftp.c (ptransfer): Change BS to be of type float.
	Improve readability by having speed estimates printed
	as `Mbytes/s', `kbytes/s', or `bytes/s' as suitable.

2014-07-30  Alfred M. Szmidt  <ams@gnu.org>

	* telnetd/utility.c (nextitem, netclear, printoption, printsub)
	(printdata): Remove register keyword usage.

	(printsub): Don't add integer to string to try and skip quote.

2014-07-28  Giuseppe Scrivano  <gscrivan@redhat.com>

	* tests/ls.c: Include <config.h> not "config.h".

2014-07-26  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	whois: Cooperate with misbehaving servers.
	Some servers, like "whois.ripe.net", "whois.arin.net",
	and "whois.eu", partially abort communication when the
	socket is closed for writing.  Report by Alexander Zubkov:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-inetutils/2014-07/msg00003.html>.

	* whois/whois.c (gwhois_argp_options): Increase GRP
	and insert a separating subheader.
	(do_query): Remove call to shutdown().  The alternate
	and much similar lookup call query_crsnic() did not
	half-close the socket for writing.

	* doc/inetutils.texi (whois invocation): Add a section
	about environment variables accessed by `whois'.

2014-07-22  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	libls: Inconsistent options.
	The options '-l', '-m' and '-n' were not overruling each
	other in the expected manner.  Build `ls' from `libls' for
	testing purposes, but do not install it.

	* configure.ac (enable_libls): Set to `no' when testing
	against `ac_cv_func_fchdir' fails.  Publish with AC_SUBST.
	[ENABLE_libls]: New variable.
	* summary.sh.in (libls_BUILD, libls_PROPS, enable_libls):
	Detect these; report whether `libls' is being built.

	* libls/ls.c (ls_main) <'l' || 'm' || 'n'>: Reset missing
	flags correctly, in order that '-l', '-m' and '-n' overrule
	each other on the command line.

	* tests/Makefile.am [ENABLE_libls] (noinst_PROGRAMS): Add `ls'.
	[ENABLE_libls] (ls_LDADD): New variable.
	* tests/ls.c: New file.

2014-07-17  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	Portability of canonical host name.
	In response to a numerical address, getaddrinfo()
	does not populate `ai_canonname' by necessity.

	* ftp/ftp.c (hookup): Copy `RES->ai_canonname' only
	if set.  Copy from RHOST otherwise.
	* ping/libping.c (ping_set_dest): Likewise; with P.
	* ping/ping6.c (ping_set_dest): Likewise, with RHOST.
	* src/traceroute.c (main): Likewise.

2014-07-16  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	Handle access timing in fractions of a second.

	* configure.ac (HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_ATIM_TV_NSEC)
	(HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_ATIM_TV_USEC, HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_CTIM_TV_NSEC)
	(HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_CTIM_TV_USEC, HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_MTIM_TV_NSEC)
	(HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_MTIM_TV_NSEC): Check for existing time field
	for sub-second timing in `struct stat'.
	(HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_BLKSTAT): Make the macro functional!

	* libls/cmp.c (modcmp) [HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_MTIM_TV_NSEC]
	[HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_MTIM_TV_USEC]: Compare in sub-seconds.
	(acccmp) [HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_ATIM_TV_NSEC]
	[HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_ATIM_TV_USEC]: Likewise.
	(statmod) [HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_CTIM_TV_NSEC]
	[HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_CT_MTIM_TV_USEC]: Likewise
	(revmodcmp, revaccmp, revstatmod, revsizecmp): Replace code
	by a simple sign change of modcmp(), acccmp(), etcetera.

	* src/rcp.c [HAVE_STAT_ST_MTIMESPEC || HAVE_STAT_ST_MTIME_USEC]
	(write_stat_time): Remove unused and obsolete code.
	[HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_ATIM_NSEC || HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_ATIM_USEC]
	[HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_MTIM_NSEC || HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_MTIM_USEC]
	(write_stat_time): Code portably for sub-second accuracy.

2014-07-14  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ftp: Hash command semantic.
	Toggle hash state when argument is not set, only then.

	* ftp/cmds.c (sethash): Activate marker when a numeric
	argument is found; toggle when no argument is present.
	A non-numeric argument leads to status reporting only.

2014-06-05  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ftp: Alternate selection of .netrc file.

	* ftp/ftp_var.h (netrc): New variable.
	* ftp/main.c (argp_options) <-N/--netrc>: New option.
	(parse_opt) <'N'>: New case.
	(main): Initialize `netrc'.
	* ftp/ruserpass.c (remote_userpass): If `netrc' is NULL,
	check NETRC in environment.  Whenever `netrc' has content,
	us it instead of `~/.netrc'.  Once CFILE is valid, make
	sure that the file location is a regular file, otherwise
	returning to the interpreter.

	* tests/ftp-localhost.sh: Two new test cases, checking the
	functionality of NETRC in environment, and the option `-N'.

2014-05-16  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ftp: Size multipliers for hash increments.

	* ftp/cmds.c (sethash): New variable P.  Detect and
	apply multipliers when setting the increment size for
	hash markers, i.e., allow commands like "hash 32m".

2014-04-29  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	hostname: Degenerate cases.
	Better replies when name resolution fails.

	* configure.ac: Remove check for gethostname in libresolv.
	If hstrerror is missing, check for it in libresolv.
	(LIBRESOLV): New variable published using AC_SUBST.

	* src/Makefile.am (hostname_LDADD): New variable.

	* src/hostname.c (get_name): Call puts() only if NAME
	carries some content.  Will, most importantly, reply
	with an empty string, not an empty line, when no aliases
	are found.
	(get_aliases): Return an empty string when the host's
	name cannot be resolved.
	(get_fqdn): Fall back to the system reported hostname
	when name resolution fails.
	[HAVE_HSTRERROR] (get_ip_addresses): Exit with an error
	when name resolution fails.

	* tests/hostname.sh: Check availability of mktemp.

	Silence warnings with libshishi.

	* libinetutils/kcmd.c [KERBEROS || SHISHI] (kcmd):

	<case 'T'>: New case.
	(logmsg): If `set_local_time' is set, use NOW to generate

2014-03-23  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ifconfig: Parse address family.
	Allow for address family argument on supported systems.

	* ifconfig/system/bsd.c (system_parse_opt_rest): New enum
	values EXPECT_COMMAND and EXPECT_AF.  Use the first to detect

	Accept only masks which correspond to changeable flags,
	using IU_IFF_CANTCHANGE.
	* ifconfig/system/bsd.c, ifconfig/system/solaris.c
	(system_parse_opt_rest): New variables MASK and REV.
	Check if the command line argument can be interpreted
	as a changeable flag argument.

2014-03-15  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ifconfig: Changeable flags on GNU/Linux.

	* ifconfig/flags.h (IU_IFF_CANTCHANGE): Remove IFF_POINTOPOINT,
	IFF_ALLMULTI, IFF_BROADCAST, IFF_MULTICAST, and IFF_PROMISC,
	since they are changeable on GNU/Linux, and they are included
	natively in IFF_CANTCHANGE on other systems.

2014-03-13  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	logger: Source address resolution.

	hostname: Sanity checks in corner cases.

	* src/hostname.c (get_name): Use reply from get_fqdn()
	only if it gave a host name, not the artificial "(none)".
	(set_name): Reject an empty host name.
	(parse_file): Initialize NAME.  Improve error message
	when getline() claims empty input.  Break out of loop
	only if sscanf() produced a printable string.

2014-02-22  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ifconfig: Allow flags richer than 16 bits.
	Systems like GNU/kFreeBSD and FreeBSD use two `short int'
	to represent interface flags.  Adapt to this fact.

	* ifconfig/changeif.c (set_flags): Apply mask 0xffff to flags.
	[ifr_flagshigh]: Calculate flag changes also on ifr_flagshigh.
	* ifconfig/flags.c [IFF_PPROMISC] (if_flags): Add user land
	setable flag "PROMISC".

	* ifconfig/options.c (formats) <unix>: Print flags numerically
	using format string "%x".
	* ifconfig/printif.c (put_flags): Change signature.  New type
	of F is `unsigned int'.  New variable UFLAGS.  Work with UFLAGS,
	not `flags'.
	(put_flags_short): New signature.
	[SIOCGIFFLAGS] (fh_ifdisplay_query, fh_brdaddr_query)
	(fh_dstaddr_query, fh_flags): New variable UFLAGS, replacing
	`form->ifr->ifr_flags'.
	* ifconfig/printif.h (put_flags): Change prototype.

2014-02-15  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ifconfig: No listing of unchangeable flags.

	* ifconfig/flags.h [!IFF_CANTCHANGE]: Define it as naught.
	(IU_IFF_CANTCHANGE): New macro.
	* ifconfig/flags.c (if_list_flags): Do not list flags that
	are known to give constant properties.  New macro FLAGS_COMMENT.
	Add its contents to the end of the requested flags listing.
	Skip a named flag if it matches IU_IFF_CANTCHANGE.  Also skip
	flags named like 'link2/altphys', since their components
	do appear in the listing.


	Portability issues in test script.

	* tests/ifconfig_modes.sh (MTU): Set to 1324 initially,
	to get above 1280 needed for IPv6 compatibility.
	The switch '-o' of uname is not portable.

2014-02-15  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	* tests/ifconfig_modes.sh: Add test case to explain
	failures to automatically bring the interface up at
	an address change.  GNU/Linux is affected by this.

2014-02-14  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	* ifconfig/flags.c (if_list_flags): Increment counter
	only in the for-statement; update the insertion of list
	delimiters.  Each second flag name was falsely scrubbed.

2014-02-14  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	Script for testing of ifconfig's modes.
	Will document all tested features.

	* tests/ifconfig_modes.sh: New file.  Intentionally
	without execution bit, and not for automatic testing.

	as a synonym for `check-existence'.

2014-02-09  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ftp: Detect one-time passwords.
	RFC 2228 reserves response code 336 for replies
	used with challange-response authentication.

	* ftp/cmds.c (user): React to response code 336 within
	FTP command `USER', print its message, and possibly
	discard an already supplied password.
	* ftp/ftp.c (login): Likewise.

2014-02-09  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ftpd: Parse commands of RFC 2228.
	Tokens are implemented, but no actions.

	* ftpd/ftpcmd.y (ADAT, AUTH, CCC, CONF, ENC, MIC, PBSZ)
	(PROT): New tokens.
	(cmdtab): New entries `ADAT', `AUTH', `CCC', `CONF', `ENC',
	`MIC', `PBSZ', and `PROT'.  All are marked as unimplemented.

2013-12-23  Alfred M. Szmidt  <ams@gnu.org>

	* doc/inetutils.texi (rsh invocation): Use @item for first entry
	in @table.

2013-12-19  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	* bootstrap: Updated from gnulib.

2013-12-13  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ftpd: Follow RFC 2577 by default.
	Prevent user name guessing as standard, but offer
	an option to keep the more informational responses.

	* ftpd/extern.h (logged_in): Remove unused variable.
	(rfc2577): New variable.
	(struct credentials): New component DELAYED_REJECT.
	* ftpd/ftpd.c (rfc2577): New variable.
	(OPT_NONRFC2577): New enum value.
	(options): New option `--non-rfc2577'.
	(parse_opt) <case OPT_NONRFC2577>: Reset `rfc2577'.
	(user): New variable RET.  After auth_user(), display
	messages in the old manner only if `rfc2577' is not set,
	or if guest access is being requested.  Otherwise, update
	`cred.delayed_reject' for later access.
	(end_login): Reset `pcred->delayed_reject'.
	(pass): On returning from auth_pass(), check also
	`cred.delayed_reject' to minimize the amount of user
	information returned to the client.


	ftpd: The standard protocol in RFC 959 demands
	that a client be informed before closing down.

	* ftpd/ftpd.c (pass) <repeated login failures>:
	Send a reply message 421 before closing connection.

2013-12-10  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	inetd: Logging of resolution and binding errors.

	* src/inetd.c (setup): Alternate syslog format,
	and debug message, when a service node has been set.
	(expand_enter): Likewise, adding debug message.


	ftp: Trivial misspelling.  Reported by Joe Steffee in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-inetutils/2013-11/msg00000.html>.

	* ftp/ftp.c (hookup): Spell `response' correctly.

2013-11-28  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	rlogind, telnet, telnetd: Modify exit status.

	* src/rlogind.c (rlogind_mainloop): Delay cleanup()
	call until libshishi has torn down its structures.
	(cleanup): New variable STATUS.  If `signo' is SIGCHLD,
	call waitpid() to reap the waiting child process and
	use its return status for the whole server's status.
	Waiting for the child resolves a race condition when
	tearing down the pseudo-terminal pair, since the slave
	now is gone when the master side is being closed down.

	* telnet/commands.c (tn): Use exit status 0 when setjmp()
	manages to execute telnet().  Otherwise, keep 1.
	(command) [unix || __unix || __unix__]: Enclose the
	complete else-block within preprocessor conditionals.

	* telnetd/pty.c (cleanup): Let STATUS have full scope
	in this function, and use it for exit().  Execute waitpid()
	only if `sig' is SIGCHLD, and update STATUS for later use.
	On SIGHUP, set STATUS to success, which happens only at
	reception of TELOPT_LOGOUT from client.
	* telnetd/state.c (dooption) <TELOPT_LOGOUT>: Call cleanup()
	with argument SIGHUP, since the client willingly leaves off.

2013-11-24  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	inetd: Ensure successful daemon mode.

	* src/inetd.c (main) <!debug>: Abort with a syslog message,
	should daemon() return unsuccessfully.
	* libinetutils/daemon.c (waitdaemon): Return with failure,
	should chdir("/") fail.


	Check all calls to chdir.

	* src/rshd.c (doit): Make a syslog error message and abort
	execution, should chdir("/") fail.
	* src/uucpd.c (doit): Abort with a message to stderr,
	should chdir("/") fail.

2013-11-23  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	Check all returns from fgets.
	Handle every failed fgets() with care.

	* ftp/cmds.c (user): Set account string to empty when
	fgets() fails.
	* src/rexec.c (main): Likewise for password string.
	* src/tftp.c (get_args): Call makeargv() only on successful
	call to fgets().  Otherwise, instantiate a trivial command
	list containing command name only.
	* telnet/commands.c (setescape): Leave escape character
	unchanged when fgets() fails.
	(tn) <get host>: Call makeargv() only for successful fgets().
	Otherwise, print a message and rely on later usage printout.
	(command): Print a line feed at EOF on stream error.

2013-11-15  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	tftp: Buffer size checking.
	Hardened builds need a helping hand in interpreting
	a bogus array length.

	* src/tftp.c (makerequest): New variables ARGLEN, LEN.
	Use them in calculating available space for file name.
	[HAVE_STRUCT_TFTPHDR_TH_U]: Calculate CP using an offset
	argument.  Needed to prevent false negatives from stack
	allocation protectors.

2013-11-05  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	Improve detection of readline.

	* am/readline.m4 (gl_FUNC_READLINE): Check for libedit
	with AC_LIB_LINKFLAGS_BODY and with AC_CACHE_CHECK.
	<readline in libreadline>: Ignore <editline/readline.h>.
	<readline in libedit>: Prefer <editline/readline.h>.
	Define HAVE_READLINE if readline() was located in one of
	the libraries, and if its use had not been disabled.
	Define HAVE_LIBREADLINE and HAVE_LIBEDIT if it was found
	in the corresponding library.
	* ftp/Makefile.am (LDADD): Remove $(LIBGLOB), $(LIBTERMCAP).
	The latter is handled by LIBREADLINE.

	* configure.ac (ftp_PROPS): Do not add $LIBTERMCAP.

2013-10-16  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	syslogd, talkd: Act on failed read_utmp.

	* src/syslogd.c (wallmsg)
	[UTMP_NAME_FUNCTION || !HAVE_GETUTXENT]: Check call
	to read_utmp() for failure, filing an error massage.
	* talkd/process.c (find_user) [!HAVE_GETUTXUSER]:
	Likewise, then returning FAILED.

	rsh: Symbolic descriptor name.

	* src/rsh.d (talk): Use STDOUT_FILENO and STDERR_FILENO
	as arguments to write().

2013-10-16  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	rsh: Kill child process after SIGPIPE.
	The default action for SIGPIPE will leave the
	child process running.  This caused, until now
	and including legacy implementations, blocking
	of stdin, and to conditionally leave also the
	remote server running.

	* src/rsh.c (end_of_pipe): New variable.
	(sigpipe): New function.
	(talk) [HAVE_SIGACTION]: New variable SA.
	<parent process>: Assign a signal handler to SIGPIPE.
	Add `&& !end_of_pipe' to the loop condition, so that
	talk() returns after SIGPIPE.  The child process will
	then be killed at the end of main().

2013-10-06  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	rsh: Detach input stream.
	The option `-n/--no-input' was incomplete.

	* src/rsh.c (main) <try_connect && null_input_option>:
	Call shutdown(SHUT_WR) on socket REM.
	(talk): Use symbolic macro SHUT_WR in shutdown().

	* doc/inetutils.texi (rsh invocation) <option '-n'>:
	Give an accurate description, forgetting about stderr.


	rshd: Better adaption to BSD.

	* src/rshd.c (doit): Use SHUT_RDWR in shutdown().
	(doit) [SHISHI] <verify checksum>: Rename local PORT
	to PPORT, since is shadows a variable of wider scope.
	(doit): Delay the call of setpgid() to also execute
	in the child process when PAM is supported.
	(doit) [HAVE_SETLOGIN]: Call setsid() and setlogin().
	Replace conditional `BSD > 43' with HAVE_SETLOGIN for
	better precision.
	[!HAVE_SETLOGIN]: Keep old call to setpgid().

2013-10-06  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	rexec: No echoing of passwords.

	* src/rexec.c: Include <termios.h>.
	(main) <password is '-'>: Call isatty().  If this
	is a terminal, print `Password:' and disable echo
	while reading password string.
	(do_rexec) <FD_ISSET(STDIN_FD)>: Write input from
	client to the outgoing socket SOCK.  This restores
	the ability to transfer contents to the server.


	rexecd: Better adaption to BSD.

	* configure.ac: Check for function setlogin.
	* src/rexecd.c (doit) [HAVE_SETLOGIN]: Before
	setting underpriviledged user, call setlogin().
	(doit) <with error port && child process>:
	Close PV[1], which is duplicate of stderr.
	[HAVE_SETLOGIN]: Call setsid(), not setpgid().

2013-10-03  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	* configure.ac (HAVE_SYSLOG_INTERNAL): Remove
	a misplaced character.

	* am/libcurses.m4 (IU_LIB_TERMCAP): Rework the
	message in AC_MSG_CHECKING() and always call
	AC_MSG_RESULT().

2013-10-02  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ftpd: Capture syntax errors.
	Scanner and parser are insufficiently trimmed to
	each other, producing duplicate and inconclusive
	diagnostic messages.

	* ftpd/ftpcmd.y (yylex) <STR1 || ZSTR1 || dostr1>:
	Remove a break at the end, continue into ZSTR2.
	This allows detection of syntax errors.  A test
	case is `quote site chmod 0750' by a client.
	(yylex): Call yyerror() only if `yynerrs' is zero.
	Otherwise both scanner and parser would send error
	messages to the client.  Specify an explicit message
	in this call to yyerror().
	(yyerror): Use parameter `s' in reply message, but
	keep a default message in case `s' is empty.  This
	passes on any diagnostic message from the parser.

2013-09-26  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ftpd: Implement FEAT and OPTS.
	Add two commands in accordance with RFC 2389.

	* ftpd/ftpcmd.y (cmdtab, sitetab): Change to static.
	(extlist): New variable, listing command extensions.
	(FEAT, OPTS): New tokens.
	(cmd) <FEAT || FEAT STRING || OPTS || OPTS STRING>:
	New cases.
	(cmdtab): Put commands in the order of RFC 959.
	Add FEAT and OPTS.
	(sitetab): Use lexicographic order.

2013-09-26  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ftp: Abort transfer in ascii mode.
	If the local ascii file causes a seek failure,
	then tell the server to abort transmission.

	* ftp/ftp.c (sendrequest) <restart_point && (STOR || APPE)>:
	Change RC to off_t.  On seek failure, send ABOR command,
	and get the reply.
	(recvrequest) <TYPE_A && restart_point>: Reset `errno'.
	<label done>: Send ABOR command, get reply.  Produce correct
	error message if stepping through the local file gave EOF.


	ftpd: Error message after seek failure.
	The standard RFC 1123 introduced a better error code 554
	to be used when a restart command is not successful.

	* ftpd/ftpd.c (retrieve) <restart_point && TYPE_A>: Reply
	with error code 554 if EOF was reach while seeking in file.
	<restart_point && !TYPE_I>: Likewise when lseek() gave EINVAL.
	(store) <restart_point>: Likewise for both modes.

2013-09-23  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ftpd: Setting of idle time.
	The command to change idle time was broken.

	* ftpd/ftpcmd.y (cmd) <SITE IDLE NUMBER>: The token IDLE
	must go before `check_login' to avoid a lookahead syntax
	error.  Adjust the parameter reference for `check_login'.

2013-09-19  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	ifconfig: Status and medium reports on BSD.

	* ifconfig/options.c (formats) <gnu, net-tools, unix>:
	Add medium and status to printout.
	* ifconfig/printif.c (format_handles): Add keys
	`media?', `media', `status?', and `status'.
	(fh_media_query, fh_media, fh_status_query, fh_status):
	New functions.
	* ifconfig/printif.h (fh_media_query, fh_media)
	(fh_status_query, fh_status): New declarations.

	* ifconfig/system/bsd.c: Include <net/if_media.h>.
	(ifm) [SIOCGIFMEDIA]: New variable.
	(media_descr): New variable.
	(subtype_descr) [IFM_SUBTYPE_DESCRIPTIONS]: Likewise.
	(ethernet_descr) [IFM_SUBTYPE_ETHERNET_DESCRIPTIONS]:
	Likewise.
	(subtype_shared_descr) [IFM_SUBTYPE_SHARED_DESCRIPTIONS]:
	Likewise.
	(option_descr): Likewise.
	(status_descr) [IFM_STATUS_DESCRIPTION]: Likewise.
	(system_fh_media_query, system_fh_media)
	(system_fh_status_query, system_fh_status): New functions.
	* ifconfig/system/bsd.h (SYSTEM_FORMAT_HANDLER):
	Add keys `media?', `media', `status?', and `status'.

	sc_prohibit_error_without_use, sc_prohibit_have_config_h,
	sc_prohibit_magic_number_exit, sc_prohibit_strncpy,
	sc_prohibit_undesirable_word_seq, sc_prohibit_xalloc_without_use
	to list.

2013-09-15  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

	telnet: Uninitialized array of pointers.
	Contemporary tgetent() emulations are known to ignore
	the scratch buffer, as well as fill it in (contrary to
	claim in manual page).  Account for this.

	* telnet/telnet.c (mklist): Return quickly in case of
	an empty first parameter `buf'.  Carefully initialize
	`*ARGVP' to NULL at every stage.


	Harmless memory leak in test program.

	* tests/localhost.c: Include <stdlib.h>.
	(main): Remove `const' on P, and it free after use.

2013-09-12  Mats Erik Andersson  <gnu@gisladisker.se>

2003-02-08  Simon Josefsson  <jas@extundo.com>

	value.  Attackers may control DNS and fool the Kerberos
	authentication code to use the wrong realm for the server, and
	consequently the wrong KDC for the server, which the attackers
	could also control.  Ultimately the attacker can fool the server
	authentication check in the client.

	workaround didn't work for some cases (namely, utmp.ut_exit, whose
	members are named differently on different systems).  When the
	autoconf is updated, the need for these macros will disappear.
	* configure.ac: Use IU_CHECK_MEMBER(S) instead of AC_CHECK_MEMBERS
	throughout the file.

2002-05-14  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>

	* tftp/tftp.c: Checks for HAVE_DECL variables must read #if

	* ftpd/ftpd.c: Likewise.

2002-05-14  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>

	* configure.ac: AC_CHECK_MEMBERS (as of version 2.53 ) fails to
	recognize the presense of a structure member which is itself of an
	aggregate type.  Thus, tests for struct ifreq.ifr_netmask and
	struct ifreq.ifr_broadaddr always fail.  To work around the bug,
	first check for a non-aggregate sub-member of the member in
	question and then create an appropriate HAVE_ define.

	Use AC_CHECK_DECLS on crypt and errno, as AC_CHECK_DECL does not
	generate HAVE_DECL_ define.

	(AH_BOTTOMs): Checks for HAVE_DECL variables must read #if
	!HAVE_DECL_something, since AC_CHECK_DECLS always declares
	HAVE_DECL, either to 0 or to 1.  The only exception is
	HAVE_DECL_HSTRERROR, whose AC_CHECK_DECLS is under a conditional
	expression, so we have to check for !defined(HAVE_DECL_HSTRERROR)
	first.

	* telnetd/pty.c (new): PTY-related functions.
	* telnetd/Makefile.am: Added pty.c

	used.

	* configure.in: When checking for utmp structure fields, always
	include sys/types.h [HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H] before utmp.h (for time_t)
	to get it working on FreeBSD.  Add checks for fields pid, id and
	user.

2001-11-02  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Add doc/Makefile as output file.

2001-11-01  Alain Magloire

	pointer with proper prototypes.
	(fuzzy_comp): Declared static.
	(exact_comp): Did not have a return value.

2001-10-29  Sergey Poznyakoff

	* talkd/acl.c: Fixed declaration of read_address().  Bugfix in
	discard_acl(): it was discarding the extra entry.  acl_match():
	Set default action to ACT_ALLOW.
	* talkd/intalkd.h: Macro os2sin_addr: extract struct in_addr from

	* talkd/talkd/process.c (open_users_acl): free (filename);
	* talkd/talkd/talkd.c (talkd_init): Do not bail out if not root,
	Do we have to be root?

2001-10-28  Alain Magloire

	Unfortunately some platforms, like QNX/Neutrino does not implement
	flow control packet mode TIOCPKT.  If it is not defined, provide
	the constant.  It should not affect the functionnality, but the
	server will not be able to process CTRL-Q CTRL-S.

	* rlogin/rlogin/rlogin.c: Define the macros TIOCPKT_XXX.
	(speed_translate): This did not work on QNX/Neutrino, since we
	were assuming things that does not hold true.  We were assuming
	that B0, B50 etc ..  were ascending constant corresponding to 0,
	1, etc ... This is not portable POSIX only says that
	cfgetispeed() return symbolic functions.  To correct use
	approximatively the same code in telnet/sys_bsd.c.

2001-10-28  Alain Magloire

	Certain programs __MUST__ be install root to work properly.  There
	is a hook in the installation to warn the user.  But maybe in the
	future we should try to install as root and failed the
	installation if it does not work?

	* ping/Makefile.am: Rules to try install setuid root.
	* rcp/Makefile.am: Rules to try install setuid root.
	* rlogin/Makefile.am: Rules to try install setuid root.
	* rsh/Makefile.am: Rules to try install setuid root.

2001-10-27  Sergey Poznyakoff

	* talkd/acl.c: read_acl(): Initialize `head' to NULL (in case the
	acl contains null hostlist).

2001-10-25  Alain Magloire

	* telnetd/telnetd/telnetd.c: Remove stupid/obsolete hack, if an
	array is declare const char *, you can not write(readonly) to it.
	This the way ISO C defines it, even if some compiler let it
	trough.  Do the right thing everytime not only for GCC.

2001-10-25  Alain Magloire

	* telnet/telnet/telnet.c: jmp_buf is an opaque struct/object we
	should not try to initialize it, and in any case globals and
	static variables are initialize to zeros, a prerequesite of ISO C.

2001-10-25  Alain Malgoire

	* talkd/announce.c: Add <sys/uio.h> for "struct iovec" definition.
	#undef MAX before redefining it.  It was set in different system
	includes.

2001-10-25  Sergey Poznyakoff

	Talkd essencially rewritten.  New feature: system-wide and
	user-specific access-control lists allow for controlling who and
	from where is able to request talks.

2001-10-25  Alain Magloire

	* syslogd/syslogd.c: Use the same code in talkd/talkd.c to handle
	utmp vs utmpx.
	(wallmesg): Use the macros when manipulating utmp functions.

2001-10-25  Alain Magloire

	* rlogind/rlogind.c (topdomain): In badly configure systems (like
	mine 8), there is no domainame, this case will cause a sigsegv.
	Because, we take for granted that local_domain_name, will be
	initialized correctly: local_domain_name = topdomain() // will
	return NULL.  Change topdomain() to return the original name on
	failure.

2001-10-25  Sergey Poznyakoff

	* libinetutils/argcv.c: (new) Simple string tokenizer.  Needed by
	talkd acls.

	* libinetutils/strsignal.c: New file.

2001-09-05  Michael Weiser <mweiser@robin.imn.htwk-leipzig.de>

	* talkd/process.c: merge redundant #ifdef's

2001-09-05 Sergey Poznyakoff

	* gwhois/Makefile.am: List built headers in BUILT_SOURCES so the
	autodependency code works.  Removed $(srcdir)/ prefix from
	targets: the source directory might not be writable, so its better
	to build headers in the build directory if they are not present in
	srcdir.  Restored EXTRA_DIST.

2001-09-04  Michael Weiser <mweiser@robin.imn.htwk-leipzig.de>

	* talkd/process.c: Guard <utmp.h> utmpx.h> properly.
	(find_user): Guard calls to setutent() or setutxent().  Use

2001-08-29  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Remove `ifconfig' for now
	(see ifconfig/TODO for a list of items that need to be resolved).

2001-08-27  Alain Magloire

	* ftpd/Makefile.am: Add EXTRA_DIST = ftpcmd.c.  To force the
	generation of the file when doing the distribution.  This way YACC
	is no longer an requirement.

2001-08-26   Alain Magloire

	* inetd/inetd.c (main): Fixed memory overryn in main 8-).
	config_files is a null terminate array of pointers.

2001-08-26  Sergey Poznyakoff

	* inetd/inetd.c: Fixed memory overrun in main.

2001-08-26  Alain Magloire

	The idea is to provide an easy way to add services without mocking
	around with inetd.conf.  It is possible to just drop a file in
	PATH_INETDDIR, and the file will be pick and merge like if it was
	a configuration file.  For example,

	/etc/inetd.d/telnet
	/etc/inetd.d/ftp
	/etc/inetd.d/login
	/etc/inetd.d/shell

	will contain the entries to start telnet/ftp/rlogin/shell without
	having to put them in /etc/inetd.conf.  The idea was submitted by
	Jakob.

	The code had a face lift to comply with GNU coding style.

	* inetd/inetd.c: prototypes changes:
	void  endconfig __P((FILE *));
	struct servtab *getconfigent __P((FILE *, const char *));
	char  *newstr __P((const char *));
	void  nextconfig __P((const char *));
	void print_service __P((const char *, const char *, struct servtab *));
	FILE           *setconfig __P((const char *));
	char          *sskip __P((char **, FILE *, const char *));
	char          *skip __P((char **, FILE *));
	(usage): Updated.
	(main): Localised the variables.  Read the line configuration
	files in to an array.
	(config): Go through the configuration files arrays and call
	nextconfig on each file for parsing.
	(nextconfig): Parse the configuration file and construct an
	service entry.

	* inetd/inetd.8: Update to document the new PATH_INETDDIR feature.

2001-08-26  Alain Magloire

	* gwhois/ChangeLog: New File.
	* gwhois/Makefile.am: EXTRA_DIST = as_del.h ip_del.h tld_serv.h So
	no need to have PERL in the distribution.  Add missing
	dependencies.
	* gwhois/whois.c: Guard <config.h> with the appropriate
	HAVE_CONFIG_H Remove macors GETOP_LONG and HAVE_GETOPT_LONG.
	inetutils always provide a version even for platforms missing it.

	* gwhois/config.h: remove and merge in whois.h

2001-08-26  Alain Magloire

	Marco D'Itri whois is much more complete then the original one
	provided by Joel N.  Weber II (devnull).  So it is enable.

	* configure.in: use gwhois instead whois
	* Makefile.am: SUBDIRS have gwhois instead of whois.

2001-08-25  Alain Magloire

	* libls/Makefile.am: use BUILD_LS.

2001-08-25  Alain Magloire

2001-08-25  Alain Magloire

	* configure.in: AC_ARG_ENABLE(libls ..) libls will not work on all
	platforms, make it possible to disable it.  LIBLS, BUILD_LIBLS,

	* header/acconfig.h: WITH_LIBLS new.

2001-08-17  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

2001-07-26  Alain Magloire

	The patch was provided by Eric Gillespie, Jr., it addresses a
	vulnerability in telnetd: TESO Security Advisory 06/10/2001

	Multiple vendor Telnet Daemon vulnerability

	Summary
	===================
	Within most of the current telnet daemons in use today there exist a
	buffer overflow in the telnet option handling. Under certain
	circumstances it may be possible to exploit it to gain root
	priviledges remotely.

	Impact
	===================
	Through sending a specially formed option string to the remote telnet
	daemon a remote attacker might be able to overwrite sensitive
	information on the static memory pages. If done properly this may
	result in arbitrary code getting executed on the remote machine under
	the priviledges the telnet daemon runs on, usually root.

	Explanation
	===================
	Within every BSD derived telnet daemon under UNIX the telnet options
	are processed by the 'telrcv' function. This function parses the
	options according to the telnet protocol and its internal state.
	During this parsing the results which should be send back to the
	client are stored within the 'netobuf' buffer. This is done without
	any bounds checking, since it is assumed that the reply data is
	smaller than the buffer size (which is BUFSIZ bytes, usually).

	However, using a combination of options, especially the 'AYT' Are You
	There option, it is possible to append data to the buffer, usually
	nine bytes long. To trigger this response, two bytes in the input
	buffer are necessary. Since this input buffer is BUFSIZ bytes long,
	you can exceed the output buffer by as much as
	(BUFSIZ / 2) * 9) - BUFSIZ bytes. For the common case that BUFSIZ is
	defined to be 1024, this results in a buffer overflow by up to 3584
	bytes.  On systems where BUFSIZ is defined to be 4096, this is an
	even greater value (14336).
	Due to the limited set of characters an attacker is able to write
	outside of the buffer it is difficult - if not impossible on some
	systems - to exploit this buffer overflow. Another hurdle for a
	possible attacker may be the lack of interesting information to
	modify after the buffer.
	This buffer overflow should be considered serious nevertheless, since
	experience has shown that even complicated vulnerabilities can be
	exploited by skilled attackers, BIND TSIG and SSH deattack come to
	mind.
	We have constructed a working exploit for any version of BSDI, NetBSD
	and FreeBSD. Exploitation on Solaris sparc may be possible but if it
	is, it is very difficult involving lots of arcane tricks. OpenBSD is
	not as easily exploitable as the other BSD's, because they do compile
	with other options by default, changing memory layout.

	* telnetd/ext.h (output_data): Add prototypes for output_data.
	* telnetd/state.c (output_data): Implement output_data().  Patch
	provided by "Eric Gillespie, Jr.".

2001-07-18  Alain Magloire

	Much of the changes where indentation to follow GNU coding style.
	Use of "const" where appropriate.  atoi() is not ANSI C nor POSIX.
	Preferable to use strto(u)l().  The same for bcopy() moving to
	POSIX mem*() functions.

	* rlogind/rlogind.c:#include <sys/stat.h> is needed for chmod ().
	#include <sys/ioctl.h> is needed for the ioctl() calls.  Remove
	the "static" scope since the functions were define whithout the
	static qualificator.
	(main): atoi() replace by strtoul() where needed.
	(rlogind_mainloop): Need to return a value since it is use as an
	argument to exit () add return 0.
	(getstr): argument is now const.
	(protocol): Initialize variables pdp and fpb gcc was complaining
	about it.
	(protocol): n was shadowed by another n previosuly declared rename
	the variable len and change its scope.
	(protocol): bcopy() replace by memmove().
	(control): argument change to size_t.
	(fatal): second argument now is const char *.

2001-07-14  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

	* rlogind/rlogind.c: use regular read() instead of getmsg() on the
	master side of pty.

2001-07-14  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

	* rlogind/rlogind.c: Rewritten from scratch.  Implemented -a
	(verify hostname) option.  Added --reverse-required and --daemon
	options.  Kerberos code is not tested, though.

2001-07-14  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

	* ping/ping.c: Use inetutils_package instead of PACKAGE.  Same for
	VERSION.

2001-07-14  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

	* libinetutils/openpty.c: Set RMSGN|RPROTDAT on master side of pty
	pair, so it can be read using read() call.

2001-07-14  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

	* libinetutils/localhost.c: Return fully qualified domain name.
	* libinetutils/login_tty.c: Rewritten from scratch.  This version
	works on systems lacking TIOCSCTTY ioctl (eg.  Solaris).

2001-07-14  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

	* configure.in: Check for setpgid(), vhangup().
	* ping/ChangeLog: (new)
	* libicmp/ChangeLog: (new)
	* libinetutils: See libinetutils/ChangeLog.
	* rlogind: See rlogind/ChangeLog.
	* ping: See ping/ChangeLog.

2001-07-10  Sergey Poznyakoff

	* ifconfig/if_index.c: Include ifconfig.h instead of if_index.h.
	Reason: ifconfig.h includes system.h which contains definition of
	ifr_index member for systems lacking it.  It also includes
	if_index.h.  Thanks to Alain.

2001-06-30  Sergey Poznyakoff

	* ifconfig/if_index.c: if_nameindex(): Actually fall back :^).
	Besides, the return value was unspecified if socked() failed.
	Removed # define ifr_ifindex ifr_index.  Use ifr_index instead of
	ifr_ifindex throughout the module, since the check for its
	presence is already made in configure.in and appropriate define is
	in system.h.  if_nameindex(): reverted condition on ioctl()
	return.

2001-06-26  Alain Magloire

	* ifconfig/if_index.c: Solaris does not define ifr_index but
	rather ifr_ifindex ... sigh ..  redefine it to ifr_index to be
	consistent.
	(if_indextoname): Typo missing closing bracket.

	* ifconfig/options.c (parse_opt_finalize): The return of getopt()
	should be an int not a char since on many OS for example
	QNX4/Watcomm C char is unsigned.

	* ifconfig/system.c: Use __QNX__
	* ifconfig/system.h: Use __QNX__
	* ifconfig/system/qnx.h: remove qfh_netmask and qfh_brdaddr, the
	generic versions will work fine.

2001-06-25  Alain Magloire

	* ifconfig/if_index.c: Fall back to the generic version if
	SIOCGIFINDEX and SIOCGIFNAME fail.  Note from Sergey.  Define
	BSD_COMP for solaris machines to include the ioctl definitions.

	* ifconfig/options.c (usage): Terminate the string with '\n\'.
	* ifconfig/printif.c (print_interfaceX): Use alloca() instead of
	dynamique allocated arrays, may compiler can not cope with this
	yet.

2001-06-23  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* ifconfig/system/qnx.c (qfh_brdaddr, qfh_netmask): Functions
	removed, the generic ones will work fine with the changes to
	system.h.
	* ifconfig/system/qnx.h: Prototypes for these functions removed.

	* ifconfig/system/qnx.h: Do not define ifr_netmask.

	* ifconfig/printif.h: Move check for HAVE_* introduced in last
	change to ...
	* system.h: ... here.

	* ifconfig/options.c: Revert change from Alain.

	* ping/ping.c, ping/ping_address.c, ping/ping_echo.c,
	ping/ping_impl.h, ping/ping_timestamp.c: Implemented
	ICMP_TIMESTAMP and ICMP_ADDRESSMASK requests.  None of existing
	routers answers the latter, though.

2001-06-13  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

	* ping/ping.c: implemented
	* ping/ping_address.c, ping/ping_echo.c, ping/ping_impl.h,

2001-06-13  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

	* libicmp/Makefile.am, libicmp/icmp.h, libicmp/icmp_cksum.c,
	libicmp/icmp_echo.c, libicmp/icmp_timestamp.c, libicmp/libping.c,
	libicmp/ping.h: added to repository.  Currently it is more libping
	than libicmp, I will be adding required functionality latter.
	* ping/ping.c: implemented
	* ping/ping_address.c, ping/ping_echo.c, ping/ping_impl.h,
	ping/ping_router.c, ping/ping_timestamp.c: added to repository.
	* paths: PATH_HEQUIV needs search in <netdb.h> (for Solaris)

2001-06-05  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

	* libinetutils/ttymsg.c (normalize_path): Define static and
	provide a prototype and it was call with the wrong number of
	arguments.

2001-06-05  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

	* ftpd/ftpd.c: MAP_FAILED is not defined on some systems

	_PATH_LOG
	* libls/print.c: Provided defaults for major() and minor() macros
	for systems lacking them.

2001-06-04  Alain Magloire

	* ifconfig/if_index.c: New version base on the one in GLIBC.
	* ifconfig/Makefile.am: Added if_index.c unconditionnaly.
	* ifconfig/changeif.c(configure_if): memset(0) ifr, it helps
	debugging.
	* ifconfig/flags.c: const consistencies.
	* ifconfig/ifconfig.h: include if_index.h
	* ifconfig/options.c: Defined SYSTEM_SHORT_OPTIONS
	SYSTEM_LONG_OPTIONS.
	* ifconfig/options.h: const consistencies.
	* ifconfig/printif.c: const consistencies.
	* ifconfig/printif.h: const consistencies.  Check for

2001-06-04  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* options.c (long_options): Only add SYSTEM_LONG_OPTIONS if it is
	defined.

	Lots of small fixes submitted Sergey Poznyakoff
	<gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>:

	* ifconfig/ifconfig.h: Do not include <config.h>.
	* ifconfig/printif.h: Likewise.
	* ifconfig/changeif.c: Include <sys/socket.h>.
	* ifconfig/ifconfig.c: Likewise.
	* ifconfig/printif.c: Likewise.
	* ifconfig/system/hpux.c: Don't include <stdint.h>.
	* ifconfig/system/osf.c: Likewise.
	* ifconfig/system/linux.c: Likewise.
	* ifconfig/system/solaris.c: Likewise.
	* ifconfig/printif.c: Likewise.
	* ifconfig/system/generic.c (system_configure): New function.
	* ifconfig/system/osf.c (system_configure): Likewise.
	* ifconfig/system/hpux.c (system_configure): Likewise.
	* ifconfig/system/solaris.c (system_parse_opt_rest): Fix order of
	operators.
	(system_default_format): Fix syntax.  Include <sys/socket.h>,
	<netinet/in.h>, <netinet/if_ether.h>
	(rather than <linux/if_ether.h>).
	* ifconfig/system.h: Change __solaris__ to __sun__.
	* ifconfig/system.c: Likewise.

2001-06-02  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

	* libinetutils/ttymsg.c: Simple check for '/' in the line name is
	way too week: it doesn't work for tty names like pts/2, which are
	perfectly OK.  Changed to more sophisticated one: all "./", "../"
	references in the name are resolved and the resulting name is
	compared with PATH_TTY_PFX.  If it lies under it, everything's Ok.
	Otherwise we just bail out and quit.
	* talk/display.c: Added check for *text == '\a' to produce audible
	bell.
	* talk/io.c: changed \007's in initial message to beep() after
	message().  On solaris's AT386 those \007 just produce ^G on the
	screen.  Changed read(0, buf, nb) to getch() in loop.  Reason:
	read() returns raw data from console, thus pressing <enter>
	returns '\r' which gets displayed on console as ^M, because
	display.c is expecting to get '\n'.  getch() returns '\n' and
	everything goes smooth.
	* talk/announce.c: syslog error message from ttymsg().  One never
	knows...
	* talkd/process.c: changed find_user().  Previous version returned
	first console the remote party was logged onto.  This one returns
	the one where he currently is.  This is a slightly modified
	version of berkeley's find_user() dated 1997/04/06.

2001-05-07  Jeff Bailey  <jbailey@oasis.zugzug.com>

	* ifconfig/system/Makefile.am: New File, for 'make dist' derived
	targets.

	* ifconfig/Makefile.am: Add printif.h and system.h to
	noinst_HEADERS.

	(many functions): Whereever we output something, set had_output to
	1.
	(join): Remove variable first.  New variable had_output_saved.
	Clear had_output after storing it in had_output_saved.  Use that
	to determine if to print delimiter.  Later on, restore had_output.
	* ifconfig/system/linux.c (some functions): Whereever we output
	something, set had_output to 1.

2001-02-26  Alain Magloire

	* libinetutils/openpty.c (ptys_open) : ioctl of "pckt" should be
	done on the master file descriptor.  Found by Joachim Gabler
	<Joachim.Gabler@germany.sun.com>

2001-02-26  Alain Magloire

	* ftp/domacro.c : Check if the margv is not NULL and return.
	* ftp/ftp.c (login) : The variable "line" is used as a target of
	strcpy.  Unfortunately, the readline() changes cause this to be
	NULL when processing an automatic login via $HOME/.netrc.  Bug and
	patch for ftp.c provided by "B.  D.  Elliott" <bde@nwlink.com>.

2001-02-22  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	list those which are missing, instead those which have it).  Add
	internationalization/gettext to the list.  Uppercase the Hurd.

2000-11-03  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* libinetutils/localhost.c (localhost): Make an initial guess of
	256 for the name length: SUSv2 says a hostname is up to 255
	characters long, and doesn't specify any error codes, so stay on
	the safe side.

2000-10-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	the top).  Replace "#ifndef lint" with "#if 0" for SCCSID to avoid
	gcc warning.

	* libls/ls.c (traverse): Fix format of error message.

	* libls/fts.c (fts_stat): Not all systems have S_IFWHT even if
	they have DT_WHT, so check for this.

2000-10-30  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* libinetutils/utmp_init.c: Define __USE_GNU before including
	utmpx to get prototype of updwtmpx.

2000-10-30  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* inetd/inetd.c: Include <grp.h> for initgroups().

2000-10-30  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	the correct output.
	(main): Beautify option parsing code (more comments, proper use of

2000-10-30  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* ftp/cmds.c (remglob): New variable fd, use it to create
	temporary file with mkstemp(), and not insecure mktemp().

2000-08-24  Alain Magloire

	* libls/fts.c: Check for HAVE_FCHDIR, and disable fchdir() for OS
	lacking.  bcopy --> memmove, bzero --> memset.

	only usefull for ftpd.
	* Makefile.am: Syslog change for logger.

2000-08-21  Alain Magloire

	The idea is to reduce the number of side effects i.e. reducing
	the number of global variables.  To help we regroup some of them
	in a structure call credentials, that is pass around.  The second
	approach to help detect side effects; when possible the variables
	are pass by parameter.  All the gots of the authentication have
	move out elsewere(auth.c, pam.c) this will save us from the pesky
	#ifdef's.

	* ftpd/ftpd.c: Passwd handling code removed.  PAM code removed.
	Variables guess, pw, logged_in, remotehost part of the credential
	structure.
	(end_login): Take the credential as an argument.
	(dolog): Likewise.
	(user): Call auth_user() to do the job.
	(pass): Call auth_pass() to do the job.

	passwd part of setproctitle() and syslog() messages.
	(main): Remove on anonymous-name, was not use.
	* ftpd/auth.c: New file.
	* ftpd/Makefile.am: PATHDEF_FTPCHROOT in INCLUDES.
	* ftpd/logwtmp.c: bzero replaced by memset.

2000-08-16  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (usage): If err != 0, print Usage: ... line
	to stdout.  Uppercase all sentences.
	(main): Fix indentation in while condition and add a newline after
	a break statement.

2000-08-16  Alain Magloire

	* logger/logger.c: syslog.c rename logger.c

	(pencode): Remove "register" attribute, format to GNU coding
	standard.
	(decode): Likewise.

2000-08-13  Alain Magloire

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (main): New variable short_options.  Removed
	of reap_child() and SIGCHLD signal handler.  ttymsg() now double
	fork() and do itself the waitpid() to clean up.  Remove all those
	little loops that uses tolower() to bring the string to loser case
	for a comparison and use strcasecmp() when comparison are needed.

2000-08-13  Alain Magloire

	* libinetutils/ttymsg.c (fork2): New function, that is doing a
	double fork() when I/O is non-bloclking.

2000-08-11  Alain Magloire

	* syslogd/syslogd.c: Include unconditionnaly <utmpx.h> and

2000-08-10  Alain Magloire

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (wallmsg): Only check for the type
	USER_PROCESS The others on GNU/Linux generate errors.  And we only
	need to alert legitimate users that are login.
	* syslogd/syslogd.c : New option '-S, --sync' to behave like
	GNU/Linux syslogd that sync on every line.  Syncing on every lines
	can bring a machine to its knees if an application is trying to be
	malicious.

2000-08-10  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (main): When -d option is given, set NoDetach

	Fix ChangeLog weirdness.
	* syslogd/syslogd.c: "New" prototype reap_childs.
	(main): Install SIGCHLD handler.
	(reap_childs): Function back.  We do fork for blocking I/O.  This
	time use waitpid unconditionally.

2000-08-09 Alain Magloire

	(usage): Some of the strings where missing newlines.
	[IOVCNT]: new macro to define the size of the iovec array.
	(fprintlog): Clear the iovec before using it.
	(logmsg): get rid of ugly hardcode and use sizeof (f->f_lastime) -
	1 intead for the len of the f_lastime string.
	(fprintlog): use sizeof(f->lastime) - 1.

2000-08-08  Marcus Brinkmann <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c: Don't prototype reapchild.
	(main): Don't install SIGCHLD handler.
	(reapchild): Function removed.  It is cruft needed for the linux
	wallmsg implementation, which we don't useb.

2000-08-08 Alain Magloire

	* rshd/rshd.c: [HAVE_INITGROUPS] guard.

2000-08-08  Alain Magloire

	* rsh/rsh.c: <sys/signal> is not portable use <signal.h>.

2000-08-08 Alain Magloire

	* rexecd/rexecd.c: Let ansi2knr take care of the vararg/stdarg
	issues.  Add prototype for error().  Guard [HAVE_INITGROUPS].

2000-08-08  Alain Magloire

	* rcp/rcp.c: Non portable d_ino for the DIR readdir() pointer
	removed.

2000-08-08  Alain Magloire

	* libinetutils/poll.c: Typo in prototypes.  Not including
	<sys/select.h>
	* libinetutils/poll.h: Typos.

	and <select.h> is not included in extern.h.

2000-08-08  Marcus Brinkmann <marcus@gnu.org>

	* doc/: Fix some factual errors, and one typo.  We don't have a
	limit on 19 sockets anymore, and we allow many -l and -s options.

2000-08-07  Alain Magloire

	* doc/doc/inetutils.texi doc/syslogd.texi First draft.

2000-08-06 Alain Magloire

	* telnet/ring.h: error in the prototype declarion of ring_mark().

2000-08-05  Alain Magloire

	* libinetutils/daemon.c (waitdaemon): We are using the double
	trick to avoid zombies and control terminals.  So we're going
	simply to pause() to avoid messing with waitpid().

2000-08-05  Alain Magloire

	* libinetutils/localhost.c: No longer use static buffers to cache
	the result.  This cause subtil bugs and make it impossible in
	non-threaded environment if we ever move to it.

2000-08-05 Alain Magloire

	* ftp/ruserpass.c (ruserpass): When calling localhost() make sure
	we free().  Various formating to GNU coding style.

2000-08-05  Alain Magloire

	* configure.in: Remove the check for setlinebuf(), it was for
	syslogd.  We use the more portable: setvbuf (stream, 0, _IOLBF,

2000-08-04  Alain Magloire

	* libinetutils/iruserok.c (iruserok): Typo in prototype.

2000-07-18 Alain Magloire

	* all C files and header files, we make a bold move and translate
	the prototypes to ANSI C, instead of K&R for better compile time
	warnings etc ..  ansi2knr will the massaging for old C compilers.

2000-07-14 Alain Magloire

2000-07-06 Michel Vogt

	This is a Linux port of the BSD ls program.  You probably aren't
	interested in this, since GNU ls is much better (IMHO).  But this
	port is needed for internal ls on inetutils-ftpd.

2000-07-06  Jeff Bailey  <jbailey@nisa.net>

	* autogen.sh: New file for generating build environment for the
	first time from a CVS checkout.  Not added to Makefile.am for

2000-06-23  Jakob 'sparky' Kaivo  <jkaivo@timothy.nodomainname.net>

	* inetd/inetd.c (main): fix typo in usage

	* inetd/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): add $(PATHDEF_INETDDIR)

	* inetd/inetd.c (config): use nextconfig()
	(nextconfig): new function

2000-06-23  Jakob 'sparky' Kaivo  <jkaivo@timothy.nodomainname.net>

	* paths: add PATH_INETDDIR

2000-06-15 David O'Shea

	* rlogin/rlogin.c (speed): the fd may not be associated with a
	terminal, when checking for speed(), take appropriate actions to
	handle the error case.

2000-06-14 Joachim Gabler

	* configure.in: add check for element ut_exit in struct utmp
	* lininetutils/utmp_logout: check for HAVE_UTMP_UT_EXIT
	* libinetutils/openpty.c: smaller fixes (missing ';', structure
	element gr_pid of struct group replaced by gr_gid

2000-03-28  Alain Magloire

	* telnetd/sys_term.c: STREAMSPTY change for HAVE_STREAMSPTY UTMPX
	change for HAVE_UTMPX.
	* telnetd/sys_term.c: modutx() change for updwtmpx().
	* telnetd/telnetd: STREAMSPTY change to HAVE_STREAMSPTY

2000-03-28  Alain Magloire

	* libinetutils/Makefile.am : added PATHDEF_WTMPX in INCLUDES.
	* libinetutils/libinetutils/utmp_logout.c: WTMPX_FILE change for
	PATH_WTMPX.

Adding poll() bring to light that we do the creation of sockets
inside init(), this has the unfortunate side effect of close()ing
and  recreating the sockets at every SIGHUP.  This was done to
speedup initialization of syslogd, since on GNU/Linux the rc.*
files would start klogd also.  This is also the reason for a waitdaemon():
"Wed Feb 14 12:42:09 CST 1996: Dr. Wettstein
Parent process of syslogd does not exit until child process has
finished initialization process.  This allows rc.* startup to
pause until syslogd facility is up and operating."

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (init): Remove call to creation of sockets and
	move it to the main() before going in the loop.

2000-08-06  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (add_funix): New function to add new unix
	sockets.

2000-08-06  Alain Magloire

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (init): Remove restriction of LINE_MAX by
	reallocating the buffer when the line is too long, by doing this
	the continuation line feature was more straightforward.  The
	downfall is dealing with out of memory errors.  But the code, so
	far, does not deal with this anywhere.
	(domark): signo ignored.
	(init): signo ignored.
	(dbg_toggle): signo ignored.
	(trigger_restart): signo ignored.  Remove superfluous
	initializations of global and static variables.

2000-08-05  Alain Magloire

Remove restrictions on options -l, -s, better compliance to GNU
coding rules .i.e no limits in the number of possible open sockets.
Code indenting to conform to GNU style.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c: Use ``const'' consistenly for readonly
	strings; cfline(), dbg_printf(), logerror(), etc ...
	Prototypes/declarations use ``void'' for consistency.  Standardise
	all function definitions, so ansi2knr could do its job properly.
	(create_inet_socket): Variable ``on'' unuse.
	(usage): try_help() and help() merge to usage (int).  usage() is
	pass an integer and exit(err);
	(main): Remove setlinebuf() use setvbuf() only.
	(main): Regroup unix sockets and fd's into the same structure
	easier to carry.  Remove restriction on 19 + 1 possible open unix
	sockets.
	(crunch_list): Take one more argument, the oldlist so it can be
	reallocated for new entries.  This removed the restrictions of the
	number of LocalHosts and StripDomains.

2000-08-05  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (help): --no-forward does not override -r, but
	-h.
	(init): Create inet socket if either AcceptRemote or Forwarding is
	true, but with Forwarding only if not --no-forward was provided.
	This is less restrictive than before, where --no-forward would
	prevent incoming messages allowed with -r, which was documented
	but not intended.
	* syslogd/syslogd.8: Document (badly) all the new options from
	last change.

2000-08-04  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c: In the whole file, change the formatting to
	conform to the GNU coding standards.  Also clean up some debug and
	error messages.  All further functional changes are listed below.

	Initialize finet and fklog to -1.  New variables NoKLog, NoUnixAF,
	NoForward, long_options, program_name.  New symbols USAGE,
	TTYMSGTIME.
	(help): New function.
	(try_help): New function.
	(usage): Use try_help.
	(main): Don't initialize finet, fklog here.  Initialize
	program_name.  Use getopt_long instead getopt.  Handle option '&'
	(--help).  Handle unknown options with try_help and usage.  Handle
	long options 'P' (--pidfile), 'F' (--no-foward), 'K' (--no-klog),
	'U' (--no-unixaf).  Move initialization of tv into the main loop.
	select meddles with the timeval on some systems (Linux) and we
	don't want to take any risk.
	(init): (Re-) Initialize fklog here if not NoKLog.  Only open unix
	sockets if not NoUnixAF.  Failing to open the primary socket is
	fatal.  Only open inet socket if not NoForward.
	(fprintlog): More diagnostic in case F_FORW: Show debug info when
	forwarding is disabled or finet is invalid for other reasons.
	(wallmsg): Use TTYMSGTIME instead hard coded default.
	(cfline): In case '|' fix nasty bug in if clause.

2000-08-03  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (waitdaemon): Removed.
	(timedout): Removed.

2000-08-03  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c: If HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H, include <sys/types> for
	pid_t.  New global variable fklog.
	(main): Fix comment.  Remove local variables fklog, sunx, sin.
	(die): Close fklog if open.
	(waitdaemon): Ansify.
	(timedout): Likewise.  Drop __unused attribute.

2000-08-03  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (waitdaemon, timedout): New prototype and
	functions from FreeBSD syslogd (rev 1.66).
	(main): Remove conditional MSG_BSIZE on line variable.  New
	variables tv, tvp, ppid.  Call waitdaemon instead daemon to fork
	into background.  Before main loop, initialize tv and tvp to zero.
	In main loop, pass tvp to select.  This will make syslogd return
	immediately until we set tvp to NULL.  Check return value of
	select.  If it is zero (no messages), and tvp is not NULL, set it
	to NULL and send parent a SIGALRM.  This will be its signal to
	terminate.

2000-08-03  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c: Include <stdarg.h>.
	(struct msg_part): Fix type declaration.
	(main): Rename variable c to l.  Initialize all of funix, finet to
	-1.  Remove dangling closing brace.  Main loop: Declare variable
	nfds.  Pass argument to init.  Add missing parentheses to
	if-clause.  Back out from using printchopped in unix and inet
	socket handling, not only because it doesn't work, but also
	because it is utterly nonsense without the S_STREAM patch.
	(make_part): Add missing brace.
	(die): Add missing variable i.

2000-08-03  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This covers the following Linux changes:
Thu Jan  6 12:07:36 CST 1994: Dr. Wettstein
Also thanks to Juha for a patch to exclude users with a class
of LOGIN from receiving messages.
Mon Oct 12 20:22:59 CEST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
Added support for setutent()/getutent()/endutend() instead of
binary reading the UTMP file.  This is the the most portable
way.  This allows /var/run/utmp format to change, even to a
real database or utmp daemon.  Also if utmp file locking is
implemented in libc, syslog will use it immediately.  Thanks
to Topi Miettinen <tom@medialab.sonera.net>.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c: Include <utmpx.h> instead <utmp.h>.
	(wallmsg): Use pointer to struct utmpx, not struct utmp.  Fix the
	size of line accoridngly.  Use setutxent instead opening the utmp
	file ourself.  Use getutxent instead fread.  Don't log to ut_type
	LOGIN_PROCESS, and don't log to ut_user LOGIN (paranoia check).
	Use ut_user instead ut_name.  Use endutxent instead fclose.

2000-08-02  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This is among others the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Thu Jan  6 12:07:36 CST 1994: Dr. Wettstein
Added support for proper decomposition and re-assembly of
fragment messages on UNIX domain sockets.  Lack of this capability
was causing 'partial' messages to be output.  Since facility and
priority information is encoded as a leader on the messages this
was causing lines to be placed in erroneous files.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c: New symbol INITIAL_PARTS.  New struct
	msg_part, new global variables parts, nparts.
	(get_part): New prototype, new function.
	(free_part): Likewise.
	(make_part): Likewise.
	(printchopped): Likewise.
	(main): New variable c.  Allocate initial parts table after
	installing signal handlers.  In main loop, use c instead i to
	count through funices.  If a read from a unx domain socket returns
	0, close this fd.  Use printchopped instead printline to support
	partial messages (a bit messy though).

2000-08-02  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c: Remove global variable InetInuse.
	(main): Check finet instead InetInuse.
	(fprintlog): Case F_FORW: Only try to forward message when finet
	is valid.
	(die): Check finet instead InetInuse.
	(init): Don't fiddle InetInuse.
	(cfline): Case '@': Don't check InetInuse (instead we check finet
	in fprintlog, see above).

2000-08-02  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	Merged from the Linux source (sysklogd 1.3):
	* syslogd/syslogd.c: New global variable restart.
	(main): Main loop: If restart is set, call init() and reset
	restart.  Install sighup_handler as SIGHUP handler.
	(sighup_handler): New prototype, new function.

2000-08-02  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

I think this is among others the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon Feb 23 23:32:35 CET 1998: Topi Miettinen <Topi.Miettinen@ml.tele.fi>
Re-worked handling of Unix and UDP sockets to support closing /
opening of them in order to have it open only if it is needed
either for forwarding to a remote host or by receiption from
the network.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (FDMASK): Removed.
	(create_unix_socket): New prototype, new function.
	(create_inet_socket): Likewise.
	(main): Remove variables funix, inetm, klogm.  Move SUN_LEN and
	creation of unix domaim sockets/inet socket to create_*_socket and
	init().  When opening PATH_KLOG, use fklog to store result.  Main
	loop: Rediddle code to use a fd_set and FD_* operations instead an
	int and bit operations.  New variable maxfds to store highest fd.
	Check fklog before checking fklog fd bit.  Check InetInuse before
	checking inet fd bit.  Clear buffer line before reading inet
	message.
	(die): Close inet socket.
	(init): New variable Forwarding and sp.  Check here for service
	syslog/udp instead in main.  Set Forwarding when appropriate (one
	of F_FORW* types).  Looping over funix here, closing and
	(re)opening unix sockets using create_unix_socket.  Closing and
	opening inet socet as appropriate.

2000-08-02  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon Oct 12 14:02:51 CEST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
Applied patch provided vom Topi Miettinen with regard to the
people from OpenBSD.  This provides the additional '-a'
argument used for specifying additional UNIX domain sockets to
listen to.  This is been used with chroot()'ed named's for
example.  See for http://www.psionic.com/papers/dns.html

	* syslogd/Note: The above link is actually ".../papers/dns/".
	* syslogd/syslogd.c (LogName): Remove global variable.
	(nfunix, funixn, funix): New global variables.
	(MAXFUNIX): New symbol.
	(main): Add option '-a' to getopt() invocation.  Learn the
	alphabet.  Add '-a' option processing.  Convert '-p' option to
	funixn.  Don't unlink LogName (doesn't exist anymore).  Create
	nfunix unix sockets in funix (using funixn)
	(also unlink funixn here).  Main loop: Diddle the readfds
	initialization a bit.  Initialize nfds on the way.  Loop over all
	funix sockets and add their descriptors.  In select call, use
	nfds+1 and not arbitrary 20.  Later, check all funix for available
	reads.
	(usage): Document '-a' option.
	(die): Don't unlink LogName, instead close and unlink all unix
	sockets in funix.

2000-08-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon Oct 12 20:49:18 MET DST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
Avoid logging of SIGCHLD when syslogd is in the process of
exiting and closing its files.  Again thanks to Topi.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (init): New variable was_initialized.  Set
	Initialize to 0 temporarily to avoid logging of SIGCHLD.

2000-08-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (main): Really fix getopt argument this time.
	Break after acting on option '-n'.
	(crunch_list): Remove semicolon that makes a prototype from the
	implementation (doh!).

2000-08-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (usage): Beautify with package name and
	version number.

2000-08-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	(oops).  Document behaviour of '-m 0'.

2000-08-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c: Fix prototype of debug_switch.
	(cfline): In case '|', check for terminal and console.  In case
	'/', rearrange this very check.
	(debug_switch): Fix parameter list to match prototype.  Don't
	install signal handler here.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (repeatinterval): Shorten from 30, 120, 600 to
	30, 60.  This is what Linux sysklogd 1.3 uses.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon Feb 10 00:09:11 MET DST 1997: Martin Schulze
Improved debug code to decode the numeric facility/priority
pair into textual information.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (textpri): New prototype and function.
	(logmsg): Use textpri in log message.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (cfline): Instead number 0 use char '\0'.
	Make debug output nicer by better alignment.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	PATH_CONSOLE.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	take into account "LOG_MARK" which has facility number
	LOG_NFACILITIES.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (main): Add "-s" option to getopt invocation.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This is based on the equivalent Linux change:
Thu Oct 19 00:02:07 MET 1995: Martin Schulze
The default behavior has changed for security reasons.  The
syslogd will not receive any remote message unless you turn
reception on with the "-r" option.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (AllowRemote): New global variable.
	(main): New option "-r" to set AllowRemote.  Only if AllowRemote
	is true add inetm to readfds and check for messages from there.
	(usage): Document new option "-r".
	(init): In start-up message, show if we allow remote messages.
	* syslogd/syslogd.8: Document new option "-r".

	(init): In start-up message, show package name and version number
	(like: "GNU inetutils 1.3.2c").

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux changes:
Audit: Coding style to comply to GNU style, cleanup the code
to be ANSI C, provide the necessary prototypes, reinforce const
policy for strings, move functions definitions only where
they are use and make them static scope if possible, variables
not exported are change to static scope, all function declarations
are ANSI C and rely on ansi2knr for OS lacking, nuke non-portable
semantics, POSIX functions/behaviour are followed intead of BSD.
The definition for setproctitle is remove, this function is to
machine dependant and we did not get it right, if the OS supplies
we'll use it.  The approach later will be to provide a fairly
portable of setproctitle() and get configure to the rigth thing, with
AC_REPLACE_FUNC (setproctitle).

	* ftpd/ftpd.c: allow_severity, deny_severity should be guarded
	with [HAVE_TCPD_H].  Move all globals to <extern.h>.  Remove
	[SETPROCTITLE] add [HAVE_SETPROCTITLE]
	[HAVE_INITSETPROCTITLE], remove setproctitle () definition.
	(main): SA_LEN () macro not portable remove.  Variable "quiet"
	change for "no_version".
	(reapchild): Use waitpid ().
	(user): Remove previous code handling of PAM.  and move the
	relevant pieces to sgetpwnam ().
	(user): when strncpy ()ing curname make sure we null terminate the
	string.
	(user): complete_login () call removed form user ().
	(delete): Use the portable S_ISDIR () marcro.
	(main): Don't typecast signal () use SIG_ERR.
	(display_file): New function.
	(statcmd): Global variable mode, rename to the more informative
	stru_mode, it was also shadowing a lot of local variable mode, for
	fopen ().
	(main): Remove initialization of global variables and initialize
	when defined.
	(main): New option '-p' to override pid file.
	(main): Adding SO_KEEPALIVE, to let the tcp/ip stack detect when
	the connection been drop, IPTOS_LOWDELAY for the control
	connection and IPTOS_THROUGHPUT for the data connection.

	* ftpd/ftpcmd.y: Remove definition of yyerror () from ftpd.c and
	move it to ftpcmd.y, result "cbuf" static scope.  Move all globals
	to <extern.h>.  Move declaration of cmdtab[] and sitetab[] to
	<extern.h>.

	* ftpd/conf.c: New file, define checkuser () and display_file ().

	* ftpd/pam.c: New file, define PAM related functions.

	* ftpd/wrap.c: New file, define TCPD related functions.

	* ftpd/server.c: New file, move all related standalone function to
	this module reapchild (), server_mode () and tcpd wrapper
	handling.

	added new option "-q" quiet to do not print ftpd version.

2000-07-08  Michael Vogt  <mvo@debian.org>

	* ftpd/ftpd.c (main): added new option "-D" for daemon-mode, ftpd
	can now run without inetd.

2000-07-07 Alain Magloire

	* ftpd/ftpd.c (sgetpwnam): if HAVE_GETSPNAM && HAVE_SHADOW_H, call

1999-17-02 Alain Magloire

	* tftpd/It has to do with handling of files with more than 32766
	blocks.  The TFTP packets should be able to handle up to 65535
	blocks.  But many tftpd's seem to treat the block# as a short
	instead of an unsigned short.  This appears to be caused by the
	arpa/tftp.h header declaring it as a short.  The relevant RFC's do
	not indicate that this is supposed to be the case.  Patch and
	Email exchange from Nathan Neulinger.

1999-17-02 Alain Magloire

Wed Nov 22 22:32:55 1995  Martin Schulze

Added the fabulous strip-domain feature that allows us to
strip off (several) domain names from the fqdn and only log
the simple hostname.  This is useful if you're in a LAN that
has a central log server and also different domains.

I have also also added the -l switch do define hosts as
local.  These will get logged with their simple hostname, too.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (LIST_DELIMITER): New symbol.
	(StripDomains, LocalHosts): New variables.
	(crunch_list): New prototype and function.
	(main): New options "-s" and "-l".
	(usage): Document "-s" and "-l".

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:

Wed Feb 14 12:42:09 CST 1996: Dr. Wettstein

	(init): Likewise.

	* syslogd/syslogd.8: Document new "-h" option.

1999-10-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Wed Jul 26 18:57:23 MET DST 1995: Martin Schulze
The 'LocalDomain' and the hostname of a remote machine is
converted to lower case, because the original caused some
inconsistency, because the (at least my) nameserver did respond an
fqdn containing of upper- _and_ lowercase letters while
'LocalDomain' consisted only of lowercase letters and that didn't
match.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (main): Try harder to get the FQDN of
	localhost and convert LocalDomain to lowercase.  (This should
	probably be in libinetutils).
	(cvthname): Add "." to output strings.  Convert hostname to
	lowercase before comparing with LocalDomain.

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Tue May 28 00:58:45 MET DST 1996: Martin Schulze
Corrected behaviour of blocking pipes - i.e. the whole system
hung.  Michael Nonweiler <mrn20@hermes.cam.ac.uk> has sent us
a patch to correct this.  A new logfile type F_PIPE has been
introduced.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c: New macro F_PIPE.
	(TypeNames): New logfile type PIPE.
	(fprintlog): Support for F_PIPE added.
	(init): Likewise.
	(cfline): Likewise, use '|' in conf file.
	(cfline): Open log files with O_CREAT and permission 0644.

	* syslogd/syslog.conf.5: Add documentation for new logfile type
	PIPE.

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon May 20 13:29:32 MET DST 1996: Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>
Added continuation line support.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (init): Add support for continuated lines
	  (implemented by Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>).

	* syslogd/syslog.conf.5: Mention continuated line feature.

1999-10-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon Aug 21 22:10:35 MET DST 1995: Martin Schulze
Corrected a strange behavior during parsing of configuration
file.  The original BSD syslogd doesn't understand spaces as
separators between specifier and action.  This syslogd now
understands them.  The old behavior caused some confusion over
the Linux community.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (cfline): Allow space as delimiter.

	* syslogd/syslog.conf.5: Seperator can now be a space, too.

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Thu Oct 26 13:14:06 MET 1995: Martin Schulze
Added another logfile type F_FORW_UNKN.  The problem I ran into
was a name server that runs on my machine and a forwarder of
kern.crit to another host.  The hosts address can only be
fetched using the nameserver.  But named is started after
syslogd, so syslogd complained.
This logfile type will retry to get the address of the
hostname ten times and then complain.  This should be enough to
get the named up and running during boot sequence.
Sat Jan 10 01:33:06 CET 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
Fixed small bugs in F_FORW_UNKN meachanism.  Thanks to Torsten
Neumann <torsten@londo.rhein-main.de> for pointing me to it.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c: INET_SUSPEND_TIME, INET_RETRY_MAX,
	F_FORW_UNKN: New macros.  TypeNames: Add "FORW(UNKNOWN)".  If
	gethostbyname fails for some host, this type will retry
	INET_RETRY_TIMES times before it finally fails.
	(fprintlog): New variable hp.  Move clearing f_time inside every
	case it is appropriate for.  Add new case F_FORW_UNKN.  New goto
	target f_forw.  Only clear f_prevcount if appropriate.
	(init): Do not close f_file for F_FORW.  Add debug output for
	F_FORW_UNKN.
	(cfline): If gethostbyname fails, set f_type to F_FORW_UNKN
	instead giving up instantly.

1999-06-08  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd/syslogd.c (MAXSVLINE): Increase number.
	(cfline): Double size of ebuf.

	* syslogd/syslogd/syslogd.c (decode): Double buffer size.

199-08-07  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd/syslogd.c (usage): Add -V option, make output
	consistent with other GNU tools.

1999-08-07  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon Oct 12 22:18:34 CEST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
Modified printline() to support 8bit characters - such as
russion letters.  Thanks to Vladas Lapinskas <lapinskas@mail.iae.lt>.

	* syslogd/syslogd/syslogd.c (printline): Make eight bit clean for
	our friends in Russia (and other).

1999-06-08  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd/syslogd.c (fprintlog): Use snprintf instead of
	sprintf.
	* syslogd/syslogd/syslogd.c: Fixed typo in comment.
	* syslogd/syslogd/syslogd.c: Include <version.h>.
	(main): Add option -V (version).
