# Script to clone specific files for creating an attack environment within a Docker container
# running a minimal Kali image

# Create a directory, so Git doesn't get messy, and enter it
mkdir attack && cd attack

# Start a Git repository
git init

# Squelch annoying message
git config pull.rebase false  # merge (the default strategy)

# Track repository, do not enter subdirectory
git remote add -f origin https://github.com/jhu-information-security-institute/NwSec.git

# Enable the tree check feature
git config core.sparseCheckout true

# Create a file in the path: .git/info/sparse-checkout
# That is inside the hidden .git directory that was created
# by running the command: git init
# And inside it enter the name of the specific files (or subdirectory) you only want to clone
echo 'applications/attack/KaliX86-64/email_common_roots.txt' >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
echo 'applications/attack/KaliX86-64/lame.txt' >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
echo 'applications/attack/KaliX86-64/setup.yml' >> .git/info/sparse-checkout

## Download with pull, not clone
git pull origin main

echo 'cd into attack/applications/attack/KaliX86-64 and view details in Dockerfile for building, running, and attaching to the container'
