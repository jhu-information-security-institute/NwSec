# Application overview
Postfix (SMTP) and Dovecot (IMAP/POP3) servers setup to run in a single Docker container.  Postfixadmin suite is also installed to facilitate easy configuration of the servers.

What is Postfix? It is Wietse Venema's mail server that started life at IBM research as an alternative to the widely-used Sendmail program. Now at Google, Wietse continues to support Postfix.

Postfix attempts to be fast, easy to administer, and secure. The outside has a definite Sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely different.

Dovecot is an open source IMAP and POP3 email server for Linux/UNIX-like systems, written with security primarily in mind. Dovecot is an excellent choice for both small and large installations. Itâ€™s fast, simple to set up, requires no special administration and it uses very little memory.

## Server (on UbuntuServerx86-64-target VM)
The VM is using Ubuntu Server OS, version 24.04.  It is designed to run within a Docker container in our [UbuntuServerx86-64-target VM](https://github.com/jhu-information-security-institute/NwSec/blob/main/config/UbuntuServerX86-64/targetVm-README.md).

## Server (on RPI4B)
The RPI4B is using Ubuntu Server OS, version 18.04.

## Client
The client that communicates with the email server is any remote SMTP server or IMAP/POP3 client.  One can also directly interface by manually applying direct SMTP commands using telnet over port 25.  E.g., see the command/response sequence below (note: commands have no indentation and  responses are indented).
<pre><code>
$ # telnet 192.168.50.46 25

# Runtime environment setup
## Server (on VM)
1. Download files to build container
    ```
    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhu-information-security-institute/NwSec/main/applications/emailsvr/emailsvr-UbuntuServerX86-64.sh
    $ chmod +x emailsvr-UbuntuServerX86-64.sh
    $ ./emailsvr-UbuntuServerX86-64.sh
    ```
1. Build, run, attach to container
    ```
    $ docker build -t temailsvr .
    $ docker run -d --name emailsvr --hostname email.netsec-docker.isi.jhu.edu --add-host email.netsec-docker.isi.jhu.edu:127.0.1.1 --dns 192.168.25.10 --dns-search netsec-docker.isi.jhu.edu --privileged --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --cgroup-parent=docker.slice --cgroupns private --tmpfs /tmp --tmpfs /run --tmpfs /run/lock --network host --cpus=1 temailsvr:latest
    $ docker exec -it emailsvr bash
1. Configure using postfixadmin by running the following command and using the guidance below `$ dpkg-reconfigure postfixadmin`
    ```
        ...
        Configuring postfixadmin
        ------------------------
        ...
        Reinstall database for postfixadmin? [yes/no] yes
        
        By default, postfixadmin will be configured to use a MySQL server through a local Unix socket (this provides the best performance). To connect with a different
        method, or to a different server entirely, select the appropriate option from the choices here.
        
          1. Unix socket  2. TCP/IP
        Connection method for MySQL database of postfixadmin: 1
        
        Database user accounts can be configured to use a variety of plugins for authentication with MySQL. If the server default won't work with this application, it is
        necessary to specify one that will. Please select one from the list of available plugins. Leaving the selection set to its original value should work unless a
        remote server is using unpredictable defaults, but other options may not be supported by postfixadmin. If problems arise, the package's documentation should give
        hints; see /usr/share/doc/postfixadmin/.
        
        Your options are:
         * default - use the default determined by the server.
         * mysql_native_password - no MySQL authentication plugin is used.
         * sha256_password - a more secure password encryption algorithm.
         * caching_sha2_password - SHA2 plus an in-memory authentication cache.
        
          1. default  2. mysql_native_password  3. sha256_password  4. caching_sha2_password
        Authentication plugin for MySQL database: 1
        
        Please provide a name for the MySQL database to be used by postfixadmin.
        
        MySQL database name for postfixadmin: postfixadmin
        
        Please provide a MySQL username for postfixadmin to register with the database server. A MySQL user is not necessarily the same as a system login, especially if
        the database is on a remote server.
        
        This is the user which will own the database, tables, and other objects to be created by this installation. This user will have complete freedom to insert,
        change, or delete data in the database.
        
        If your username contains an @, you need to specify the domain as well (see below).
        
        Advanced usage: if you need to define the domain that the user will log in from, you can write "username@domain".
        
        MySQL username for postfixadmin: postfixadmin@localhost
        
        Please provide a password for postfixadmin to register with the database server. If left blank, a random password will be generated.
        
        MySQL application password for postfixadmin: nwsec123
        
        Password confirmation: nwsec123
        
        Determining localhost credentials from /etc/mysql/debian.cnf: succeeded.
        Please provide the name of the account with which this package should perform administrative actions. This user is the one with the power to create new database
        users.
        
        For MySQL, this is almost always "root". Note that this is not the same as the Unix login "root".
        
        Name of the database's administrative user: root
        ...   
    ```
1. Edit `/etc/postfixadmin/dbconfig.inc.php` and change value of line with `$dbtype` from `mysql` to `mysqli`
1. Edit `/etc/dbconfig-common/postfixadmin.conf` and change value of line with `dbc_dbtype` from `mysql` to `mysqli`
1. Log in to `http://email.netsec-docker.isi.jhu.edu/postfixadmin/setup.php`
    * Specify a setup password and copy the generated hash into the value for the setup_password variable in `/etc/postfixadmin/config.inc.php`
    * Then, create a superadmin account `postfixadmin@netsec-docker.isi.jhu.edu` and specify its password
1. Use that superadmin account to log in to `http://email.netsec-docker.isi.jhu.edu/postfixadmin/login.php`
    * Create a new `netsec-docker.isi.jhu.edu` domain 
    * Create new email accounts in the `netsec-docker.isi.jhu.edu` domain
    * Note, you will need to create an email account for superadmin user
1. Use Mozilla Thunderbird for a mail client from the VM or another container to access email

## Server (on RPI4B)
1. Set your hostname: `$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname your-fqdn`

`$ sudo ufw allow 25/tcp`, `$ sudo ufw allow 80,443,587,465,143,993/tcp`, and `$ sudo ufw allow 110,995/tcp`
1. Build the Docker container using: `$ sudo docker build -t temailsvr .`
1. Start the Docker container using: `$ sudo docker run -d --name emailsvr --privileged -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro --network host temailsvr:latest`
1. Log in to the running container using: `$ sudo docker exec -it emailsvr bash`
1. From inside the docker session, enable servers using: `# systemctl enable postfix && systemctl enable dovecot`

# Notes
* Restart the server using: `$ sudo systemctl restart postfix`
* Restart the server using: `$ sudo systemctl restart dovecot`
* Check the server status (there should be no errors) using: `$ sudo systemctl status postfix`
* Check the server status (there should be no errors) using: `$ sudo systemctl status dovecot`
* View the server log: `$ sudo journalctl -u postfix`
* View the server log: `$ sudo journalctl -u dovecot` and `$ sudo tail -f /var/log/dovecot.log`
